# bacterial_ecology

This is part of my Masters thesis project at the University of Auckland. The program is written in JavaScript and utilises Bram van Dijk's Cacatoo library. I will attach a link to the Cacatoo page and Bram's blog at the end of this script.

This project uses the cellular automata theory to simulate bacterial metabolic activity on a single particle of consumable resource.
