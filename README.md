# bacterial_ecology

This is part of my Masters thesis project at the University of Auckland. The program is written in JavaScript and utilises Bram van Dijk's Cacatoo library. I will attach a link to the Cacatoo page and Bram's blog at the end of this script.

This project uses the cellular automata theory to simulate bacterial metabolic activity on particles of consumable resource.

The bacteria being simulated are of the cooperator, cheater and privatiser strategies. My project aimed to explore their competitive interactions and find if they can coexist.
